# 👋 Hi — I’m Mobin

I’m a full-stack developer with a practical focus on **server-side engineering** and **desktop application development**.  
I work primarily with **C# (.NET)**, **PHP**, and **XAML**, building robust, secure, and efficient systems that perform reliably at scale.  
My code philosophy: *clarity, consistency, and zero unnecessary magic.*
